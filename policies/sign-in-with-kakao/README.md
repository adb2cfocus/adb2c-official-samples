# Setting up **Sign in with Kakao** as a Custom OAuth2 provider

This sample shows how to setup **Kakao** as an identity provider in Azure AD B2C. **Kakao** is a South Korean Internet company that provides a diverse set of services.

There is no Kakao page in the official documentation, but the documentation for [setting up sign-in with Google using custom policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-custom-setup-goog-idp) shows you the important steps in creating a custom policy that integrates with an OAuth2 provider. The following documentation will help you registering your app with Kakao and do the custom policy modifications that are unique for it.

## Kakao Developer Platform steps
You need to [create your account at KakaoDevelopers_](https://developers.kakao.com/apps) first and then create your app registration:

1. Select **+Create new app** in the drop down menu and give your app a name.

2. Add Platform **Web** and enter a uri in the Site Domain. This is not the Redirect URI and do not need to be valid.

3. Activate the app under **User Management**, and add ***profile*** and ***email*** as **Consent Items** so they are returned as claims.

4. In the **Redirect URI**, fill in the B2C redirect url (replace yourtenant for your tenant).
`https://yourtenant.b2clogin.com/yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`

5. Under ***Settings > General***, copy the ***REST API Key*** and save it. It is your client_id.

6. Under ***Settings > Advanced***, create a Client Secret and save it. It is your client_secret and we need to add it to the B2C portal.

## Azure Portal
You need to [create a policy key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-custom-setup-goog-idp?tabs=applications#create-a-policy-key) in Azure AD B2C. Name the policy key `B2C_1A_KakaoAppSecret` and set the value to the client secret you generated in step 6 above.

## Edit and upload the Custom Policy
The file [SignUpOrSigninWithKakao.xml](policy/SignUpOrSigninWithKakao.xml) is based on the [SocialAndLocalAccounts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/tree/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts) from the Azure AD B2C Custom Policy Starter Pack.

Changes you need to do are:

1. Replace All ***yourtenant*** to the name of your tenant
```XML
<TrustFrameworkPolicy
  TenantId="yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"
  PolicyId="B2C_1A_Kakao_susi"
  PublicPolicyUri="http://yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_Kakao_susi"
```

2. Change the PolicyIds to your liking. Note that the BasePolicyId is named B2C_1A_**Kakao**_TrustFrameworkExtensions, so you probably need to edit that to point to your working TrustFrameworkExtensions file. 
```XML
  <BasePolicy>
    <TenantId>yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com</TenantId>
    <PolicyId>B2C_1A_Kakao_TrustFrameworkExtensions</PolicyId>
  </BasePolicy>
```

3. Replace the client_id value in the ClaimsProvider section with the value from step 5 above.
```XML
    <ClaimsProvider>
      <Domain>Kakao</Domain>
      <DisplayName>Login using Kakao</DisplayName>
      <TechnicalProfiles>
        <TechnicalProfile Id="KakaoProfile">
          <DisplayName>Kakao</DisplayName>
          <Protocol Name="OAuth2" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="ProviderName">kakao</Item>
            <Item Key="authorization_endpoint">https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/authorize</Item>
            <Item Key="AccessTokenEndpoint">https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/token</Item>
            <!-- Kakao doesn't have a /Userinfo endpoint, so we'll use the /user/me and map the data it returns -->
            <Item Key="ClaimsEndpoint">https://kapi.kakao.com/v1/user/me</Item>
            <Item Key="scope">account_email profile</Item>
            <Item Key="HttpBinding">POST</Item>
            <Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">0</Item>
            <Item Key="client_id">...</Item> <!-- REST API Key from Kakao Settings > General -->
```

4. In the RelyingParty section at the bottom, add your own ApplicationInsight key
```XML
    <UserJourneyBehaviors>
      <JourneyInsights TelemetryEngine="ApplicationInsights" InstrumentationKey="...your key..." DeveloperMode="true" ClientEnabled="true" ServerEnabled="true" TelemetryVersion="1.0.0" />
    </UserJourneyBehaviors>
```

5. Then upload the policy and you are ready to test run it.

## Signing in with Kakao
When you test run your policy, you should see a button labeled **Kakao**. You can do some UX customization to get the real icon for the button. 

![An option to select Kakao in the SUSI page.](media/kakao-susi-page.png)

Clicking that button will take you to Kakao's login page. The first time you need to accept the Consent, but then you will be redirected back to B2C and continue with completing your self asserted information. Kakao will only emit the email, the users unique identifier and the users nickname.
