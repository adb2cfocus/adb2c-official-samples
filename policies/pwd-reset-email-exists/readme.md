# Password Reset verification code only sent if email is registered

Demonstrate how to use a [display control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/display-controls) to send verification code to users only if the email is registered against a user in the directory.

## Live demo

To test the policy, follow these steps:

1. If you don't have an account, [create a local account](https://b2clivedemo.b2clogin.com/b2clivedemo.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_signup_signin/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=cfaf887b-a9db-4b44-ac47-5efff4e2902c&nonce=defaultNonce&redirect_uri=https://jwt.ms&scope=openid&response_type=id_token&prompt=login) with your email address.
1. [Run](https://b2clivedemo.b2clogin.com/b2clivedemo.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_Demo_PasswordReset_AccountExists/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=cfaf887b-a9db-4b44-ac47-5efff4e2902c&nonce=defaultNonce&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjwt.ms&scope=openid&response_type=id_token&prompt=login) the *B2C_1A_Demo_PasswordReset_AccountExists* policy to reset the password.
1. Perform the following test:
    1. In the *Email Address* provide an email address that is not registered in that directory. For example, `bob@fabrikam.com`, and select *Send verification code*. You should get an error message that the email address is not registered in the system.
    1. [Run](https://b2clivedemo.b2clogin.com/b2clivedemo.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_Demo_PasswordReset_AccountExists/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=cfaf887b-a9db-4b44-ac47-5efff4e2902c&nonce=defaultNonce&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjwt.ms&scope=openid&response_type=id_token&prompt=login) the *B2C_1A_Demo_PasswordReset_AccountExists* policy again. This time type the email address your register in the first step. Complete the password reset process. 

## Prerequisites

- You can automate the pre requisites by visiting the [setup tool](https://aka.ms/iefsetup) if you already have an Azure AD B2C tenant. Some policies can be deployed directly through this app via the **Experimental** menu.

- You will require to [create an Azure AD B2C directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant).

- To use the sample policies in this repo, follow the instructions here to [setup your AAD B2C environment for Custom Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom).

## How it works

Before generating and sending a verification code, we first take the users email and lookup the directory for a user. If a user is returned we will have the objectId claim in the claims bag. 

Using a precondition, on the basis of the objectId existing in the claims bag, we will send out the verification code. The XML snippet below demonstrates this.

```xml
<Action Id="SendCode">
<ValidationClaimsExchange>
    <ValidationClaimsExchangeTechnicalProfile TechnicalProfileReferenceId="AAD-UserReadUsingEmailAddress-emailAddress" />
    <ValidationClaimsExchangeTechnicalProfile TechnicalProfileReferenceId="AadSspr-SendCode">
    <Preconditions>
        <Precondition Type="ClaimsExist" ExecuteActionsIf="false">
        <Value>objectId</Value>
        <Action>SkipThisValidationTechnicalProfile</Action>
        </Precondition>
    </Preconditions>
    </ValidationClaimsExchangeTechnicalProfile>
</ValidationClaimsExchange>
</Action>
```
