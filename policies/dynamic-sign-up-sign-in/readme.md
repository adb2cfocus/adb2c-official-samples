# Dynamically sign in or sign up the user

This sample allows dynamically detecting whether a user can sign in or sign up. The user enters their email and selects *Sign-in*. If the account exists, the user is asked to verify their password. Otherwise, if the account does not exist, the user goes through a sign up flow.

## Live demo

To test the policy, complete the following steps:

1. [Run](https://b2clivedemo.b2clogin.com/b2clivedemo.onmicrosoft.com/B2C_1A_Demo_SignUp_SignIn_Dynamic/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=cfaf887b-a9db-4b44-ac47-5efff4e2902c&nonce=defaultNonce&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjwt.ms&scope=openid&response_type=id_token&prompt=login) the *B2C_1A_Demo_SignUp_SignIn_Dynamic* policy. In the sign-up or sign-in page provide an account that doesn't exists in the directory. Select *Sign-in* and Azure AD B2C will take you to the sign-up page (the email is read only).

In the sign-up or sign-in page provide the email address that you used in the previous step. Select *Sign-in* and Azure AD B2C will ask you to provide the password.

In the sign-up or sign-in page select the *Sign-up now* link. Azure Azure AD B2C will take you to the sign-up page where you provide and verify your email address.
