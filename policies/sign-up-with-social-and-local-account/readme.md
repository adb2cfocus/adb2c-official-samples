# Azure AD B2C: Sign-up with social and local account

With Azure AD B2C a user can have multiple identities. Sign-in with local account, and link a social account to an existing local account. This Azure AD B2C sample demonstrates how to create a single account with social and local identities.

This is scenario may help in case you provide the user the ability to sign-in with your organization account (such as ADFS, Azure AD, or Salcefoce account), but also want to allow users to continue sign-in with their local account after they leave the organization. For example, a user may not belong anymore to the organization, but he/she should still be able to access the application. With this demo, when user sign-in with Facebook account, you ask the user to provide and verify the email address and password. When B2C creates the account, the account is created with:
- **signInName** containing the email address for the local identity
- **password** for local identity
- **userIdentities** with the social or enterprise id, for the social identity
- User profile, such as first name, last name, and display name
 
Following is an example of such account:

```JSON

{
    "displayName": "Yoel Hor",
    "givenName": "Yoel",
    "jobTitle": null,
    "surname": "Hor",
    "signInNames": [
        {
            "type": "emailAddress",
            "value": "your@contoso.com"
        }
    ],
    "userIdentities": [
        {
            "issuer": "facebook.com",
            "issuerUserId": "RTEwAjQwBTM7Mjg4NERv"
        }
    ]
}
```
